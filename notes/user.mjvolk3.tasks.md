- [x] Sparse transformer softmax `argparse`.
- [x] Sparse transformer softmax implementation.
- [ ] NN order invariant MLPs, mlp mlp concatenate mlp.
- [ ] Implement CNN maybe consider adding atomic mass [[src/mist/utils/chem_utils.py]].

## 2023.04.29

- [x] Add arg for encoder.
- [x] Move ML to [[src/mist/g11_mlp.py]] and test model still runs.
- ðŸ”² Add GNN to [[src/mist/g11_mlp.py]] and test model still runs. â†’ Did not want to convert all data into graphs. Graphs would be shallow and MLP solutions can be used.
